# Portfolio Website Example

This is a recreation of the single-page portfolio. This was doing using bootstrap for practice purposes. It deviates from the original in some ways; most notably the nav-bar for smaller screens has a toggle button.

Shadows were also placed on hover on background-images in the work section and these elements were also made cards.

One drawback of using cards is I could not find a way to move a child-container left within the card- I am sure there is a solution with other bootstrap classes here but I simply do not have time to debug as the solution does not seem straight-forward.

Although I prefer the look and feel of the original, I made a concerted effort on this one to only use classes for CSS and IDs for scripts. I am quite happy with the results; I feel my command of classes is getting stronger...!
